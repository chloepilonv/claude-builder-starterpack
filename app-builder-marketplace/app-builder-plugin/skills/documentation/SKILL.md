# App Builder — Phase 8: Documentation & Cleanup

Invoke the `docs-agent` subagent to clean the repository and write documentation.

This phase can run at any point after Phase 5 (MVP complete).

Pass any `$ARGUMENTS` as focus areas (e.g. "focus on API docs" or "skip cleanup, just write README").

After completion, update `.app-builder/state.json` to mark Phase 8 as done.
